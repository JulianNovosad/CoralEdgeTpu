f course. Here is a summary of our session:                                                                         
                                                                                                                       
  We began by verifying the state of a C++ object detection project for a Raspberry Pi with an Edge TPU. We found that 
  while dependencies like FlatBuffers and TensorFlow Lite were partially built, the main application was a             
  placeholder, and the build system was not functional.                                                                
                                                                                                                       
  The development process involved:                                                                                    
   1. Fixing the Build System: We created and debugged a build.sh script and CMakeLists.txt, resolving numerous issues 
      related to incorrect paths, missing build tools (pkg-config), and persistent CMake caching errors.               
   2. Implementing the Application: We created a multi-threaded application architecture, implementing separate C++    
      modules for camera capture (libcamera), inference (TensorFlow Lite with Edge TPU delegate), an MJPEG server, a   
      UDP sender, JPEG encoding, and logging.                                                                          
   3. Resolving Compilation Errors: We worked through and fixed a long series of C++ compilation errors, including     
      missing headers, API mismatches with the installed libcamera version, incorrect TFLite API usage, and various    
      logic errors in the newly written code.                                                                          
   4. Addressing Runtime Errors: After a successful compilation, the application failed to start the camera, giving a  
      "Failed to allocate buffers" error. We also identified a deadlock that caused the application to hang on         
      shutdown. We were in the process of debugging these two final issues, starting with an investigation of the      
      system's libcamera header files to ensure correct API usage.                                                     
   5. User Requests: User requested to hardcode the model and label paths, which we did, and this led to the final set  
      of runtime errors we are currently debugging.
